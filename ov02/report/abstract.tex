\section{Abstract}
For this assignment we wrote a program producing distinct sounds when buttons on the microcontroller
where pressed. The program was witten in C without an Operation System. We used the internal DAC to make audible audio waves.\\
\\
A high-level programing language like C gives you a nice abstraction from the hardware while still
being able to maintain direct control over it. Compared to assembly it is much simpler to create abstract datatypes and
dealing with variables instead of registers.\\
\\
Programming without an Operation System gives us full control over the hardware, but it does not
provide any abstractions, like device drivers. This requires us to implement a partial driver for
all the devices that we want to use. In this assignment we use LEDs, buttons and the DAC.
