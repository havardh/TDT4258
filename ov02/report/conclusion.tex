\section{Conclusion}
During this assignment we have experienced the advantage of higher level programming languages.
We followed the recommended approach, and found solving the previous assignment i C to be a fraction
of work compared to using assembly. As with the last assignment, we were reminded about the challenges
when working with analog signals, and some new challenges were faced when working with digital audio,
and real-time requirements.\\
\\
We learned that the time limitations, limited computing powers and memory size means we have to adapt new ways to
solve problems. Problems that might seem trivial when spoiled with GHz and GB in our development environments.
