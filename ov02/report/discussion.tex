\section{Discussion}
This assignment was easier getting started with, because we knew the tools,  and the programming language.
Off course handling I/O devices without an Operating System was a new experience. We found having a little
knowledge of music- and wave-theory quite favorable, but the recitation slides and the compendium worked as
good summary and reinstatements of the theory.

\subsection{Deadline}
Deadline are the time restriction on the interrupt routine. The ABDAC interrupts with a frequency of 81.920 kHz.
If it does not get a new sample in SDR before 256 cycles then we have missed a deadline. When we compile with
different optimizations flags on gcc (-O0, -O1, -O2, and -O3) we get slightly different sounds and speeds of the
audio samples. This indicates that our interrupt routine is to long and that we are missing some deadlines.
We found that -O1 gave us the best result.
