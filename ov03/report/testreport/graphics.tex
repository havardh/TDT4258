\subsection{Graphics}

\subsubsection{Test program}
While developing the {\bf Graphics} module the program in
/graphics/test was incremently modified to test each new addition to
the module.

The final test program tests the {\bf Rectangle} object which in turn
utilizes the {\bf Line} object. And creates an animation with two {\bf
  Bitmap} images.

\begin{lstlisting}
int main(void) {
  canvas();
  sleep(2);
  image();

  return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Running the testprogram}
The Graphics module has its own {\bf Makefile} in /graphics/Makefile.
This builds the testprogram in the bin/graphics\_test executable. This
can be transfered to the development board with the {\bf scp}
command. In order to run it successfully the folder where it is runned
must contain a folder named {\bf data} containing a file called {\bf
  box.bmp}. This file must be a 24 bit {\bf BMP} file.

\subsubsection{Expected result}
The screen should show two black hollow rectangles on a white
background. After two second the should be replaced with the two
instances of the image in the {\bf data} folder. On of which should
slide from left to right over the screen. When they meet the moving
image should pass behind the fixed one.

\subsubsection{Test result}
As expected
