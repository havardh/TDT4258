\subsection{Game}
The game was simply tested during development, the iterative process of implementing
small parts and testing them, eventually led to a fully working game. There are 
mainly three things that should work;
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Player A should be able to move the tank
  \item Player B should be able to move the cannon aim
  \item The game should end in favour to player A if the tank reaches the turret, or it
  	should end in favour to player B if the turret hits the tank.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Tank movement}
The tank should be able to move in all four directions, and accross the whole field. The only 
restrictions is when trying to move out of the field (the bounds of the game) and when
trying to move over fire. When the tank enters the top left tile, i.e. the location of the 
turret, the game should end in favour to the tank. Thus the tank can find itself in four
different situations;
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Trying to move over open field
  \item Trying to move over fire
  \item Trying to move out of the field
  \item Trying to move on top of the turret
\end{enumerate}
We have tested all these situations from two to four different angles, and they all
work according to the expectations.

\subsubsection{Turret movement}
The turret does not have the same controls as the tank, but it beahves almost the same. 
It should be able to aim over the whole field and shoot anything, except for itself
