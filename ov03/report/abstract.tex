\section*{Abstract}
In this assignment we had access to the Linux 
operating system installed on an SD card that was 
plugged in to the STK1000 development board. The task
was to write two Linux device drivers for the lights and 
the buttons on the STK1000, let the drivers be recognized 
by Linux and being able to use these drivers through a 
C-program. More specifically, the task was to write a 
computer game called Scorched Land,
that used the audio and screen on the STK1000
and the game was to be controlled by input from the 
buttons on the development board.\\
\\
The main difference from this excercise and the 
other two, is that we had
access to an operating system with appropriate 
drivers to e.g. screen and audio. This makes it possible
to make rich programs that uses all the different devices
that the STK1000 offers, without having to go through
the trouble to write the drivers ourself.
