\section{Conclusion}
During this assignment we have worked within a more familiar environment of  libraries and coding style. Yet still, we have been introduced to new parts of Linux, like the inside of device drivers. To be able to use libraries, and tools like ssh, we have streamlined the development procedure compared to the previous execises. 

To sum up all the lab assignments; it has been a fun and invigorating exercise program. The course is one of few that has a practical exercise program, and that is definetly a positive break in a theoretical everyday life.
