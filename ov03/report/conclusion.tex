\section{Conclusion}
During this assignment we have worked within a more familiar environment of  libraries and coding style. Yet still, we have been introduced to new parts of Linux, like the inside of device drivers. To be able to use libraries, and tools like ssh, we have streamlined the development procedure compared to the previous excises.

We have experienced the benefits of device drivers as an abstraction layer between software and hardware. To be able to work with hardware using interfaces of drivers, makes the process of I/O less complex. Device drivers in Linux are easy to understand, because of the idea of devices as files. The simple interface of drivers does limit the possibilities of drivers in a way that we have understood is necessary.

Through the exercise we have also learned about the kernel mode, and the imitations you meet, and the possibilities you can gain through trapping into KM.

To sum up all the lab assignments; it has been a fun and invigorating exercise program. The course is one of few that has a practical exercise program, and that is definitely a positive break in a theoretical everyday life.
