\subsection{Sound}
In the folder /sounds the module {\bf Audio} takes care of playing sounds. It uses ordinary file
operations, {\bf fputc} and {\bf fgetc}, to write 8 bit samples to the file {\bf /dev/dsp}. The
interface of the module is the {\bf AudioPlay}. It takes a filename as a parameter and plays the
sound back concurrently using the {\bf pthread} package.

\subsubsection{Wave - Fileformat}
The 8 bits per sample, 8000 samples per
minute \footnote{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP\_file\_format}{Wave file format} can be played
back directly by \footnote{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline\_(Unix)}{pipeing} the file to {\bf
  /dev/dsp}. This format was chosen for this property as a complex sound module was not a priority
in this assignment.
