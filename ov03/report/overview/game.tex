\subsubsection{Design}

The /game folder contains the objects used in the game. The most importaint is the {\bf Controller}
which handles the communication between the modules in the game. The {\bf Cannon}, {\bf Tank} and
{\bf Field} are models for the objects in the game. The {\bf Button} and {\bf Led} objects are
wrapper object around the char drivers, to make communication easier.
