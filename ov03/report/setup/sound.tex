\subsection{Sound}
\label{sec:alsa}

In order to have audible sound on the board the sound setting in Linux must be set correctly.

This can be done by opening the alsamixer (execute {\bf alsamixer} as root at the shell prompt).
Here all items should be unmuted, select the item with the arrows and unmute with the {\bf m} key.
The items must also be set to appropiate levels, the levels are set with the arrow keys. Exit
the program with the {\bf ESC} key.
