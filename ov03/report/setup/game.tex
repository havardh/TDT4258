\subsection{Game}

To play the game it has to be compiled from the source, copied onto the board and started.
This can be done from any of the lab pc's in the lab which contains the {\bf avr32-linux-gcc} compiler.

\subsubsection{Compilation}
From the /game directory on the lab pc the following command will compile the game:
\begin{verbatim}
  make
\end{verbatim}

This produces the file /game/bin/game which is a executable that can run under the linux distribution
installed on the SD-card.

\subsubsection{Copying the executable to the board}
From the /game directory on the lab pc the following caommand copies the game executable to the board.
\begin{verbatim}
 scp bin/game avr32@<IP address>:~/
\end{verbatim}
Where {\it $<$IP address$>$} is the IP obtained in section <...>.

\subsubsection{Running the game}
From the /home/avr32 directory on the board the game can now be started with:
\begin{verbatim}
  ./game
\end{verbatim}

In order to play the game the user has to be root, this is obtained by running the {\bf su} command
and using password = roota.
