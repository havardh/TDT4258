\subsection{Board}

To prepare the board for installing the drivers and the game the following must be done:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The jumpers and GPIO connectors must be placed properly.
  \item The bootloader must be installed onto the board.
  \item Linux must be installed onto a SD-card.
  \item Linux must be booted with the help of uBoot and Minicom.
\end{enumerate}

This section is a walkthrough of this process.


// env variabel for u-boot.
\begin{verbatim}
  bootcmd 'mmc init; ext2load mmc 0:1 0x90400000 $(fileaddr); bootm 0x90400000'
\end{verbatim}
