\subsection{Naming convetions and pattern}

An object-oriened pattern was applied, where object method names are prefixed with the class name.
The contructor methods are called {\it ...New} and the destructor methods are called {\it ...Destroy}.
All methods take a pointer to the object as the first parameter.

Here is the prototypes for the {\bf Screen} class as an example.

\begin{lstlisting}
typedef struct {
  ....
} Screen;

Screen ScreenNew( int width, int height );
void ScreenDestroy( Screen* );
void ScreenDrawPixel( Screen*, int, int, Pixel*);
void ScreenFlush( Screen* );
\end{lstlisting}
