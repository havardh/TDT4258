\section{Discussion}
This assignment sums up all the exercises in a good way. Working with the same I/O devices as earlier, but with an operating system to support the procedures, we understand the power of an OS. The result of the assignment is a fully functional game that uses the hardware we have explored through the assignments. That is a concrete result that leaves the impression of having completed something, although it might not be the most entertaining game we have ever played.
